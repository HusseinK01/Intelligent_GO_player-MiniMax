# MiniMax Algorithm for GO Game AI

## Overview
Our project aims to implement the MiniMax Algorithm to develop an AI agent capable of playing the ancient board game of GO. GO is a strategic game that involves placing black and white stones on a 19x19 grid called a GOBAN. The objective is to control more territory than the opponent by surrounding empty areas and capturing opponent stones.

## Project Goal
The primary goal of this project is to create an AI agent that can make intelligent decisions in the game of GO using the MiniMax Algorithm. The MiniMax Algorithm is a decision rule used in artificial intelligence, decision theory, game theory, and statistics for minimizing the possible loss for a worst-case scenario. In the context of GO, the AI agent will simulate the entire game to evaluate all possible moves and choose the move that maximizes its chances of winning.

## Implementation Details
- **Algorithm**: MiniMax Algorithm
- **Game**: GO (19x19 grid)
- **Libraries**: Python (for implementing the algorithm), Pygame (for GUI)

## Features
- **Intelligent Move Selection**: The AI agent analyzes all possible moves using the MiniMax Algorithm to select the move that leads to the highest score.
- **Game Simulation**: The AI agent simulates the entire game to anticipate the opponent's moves and plan its strategy accordingly.
- **GUI Interface**: The game is presented with a graphical user interface (GUI) using the Pygame library, providing an interactive and visually appealing gaming experience.

## How to Run
1. Ensure Python and Pygame are installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Run the main Python script to start the game.
   ```
   python main.py
   ```
